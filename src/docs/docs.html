			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Habit Alarm is a simple productivity extension designed to reward your productive actions with browsing time. You start off with zero minutes and, upon performing a good habit or completing a task, you can give yourself a desired amount of time to continue browsing distracting websites.</p>
			<h2>How to Use</h2>
				<h3>(Un)Blacklisting Websites</h3>
				<p>To blacklist websites, simply go to a desired website, click the badge icon in the top right of your browser <img src="/icons/border-48.png" class="icon">, go to the settings page <img src="/popup/res/spanner_icon_small.png" class="icon">, and click "Blacklist this website". Likewise, to unblacklist the website, click "Unblacklist this website". If you desire to clear your blacklist, click "Clear Blacklist".</p>
				<p>Note: Websites are blacklisted on a domain-name basis. For example, if your current page's url is "https://website.com/subpage", https://website.com will be blacklisted and any other subpages <i>will</i> reduce browsing time. Blacklisting is only designed for http://, https://, and domain-first urls (for example, website.com)! Anything else will not work properly, but for all practical purposes every website will be able to be blacklisted.</p>
				<h3>Giving Yourself or Taking Away Time</h3>
				<p>To reward your productive actions with browsing time, click the badge icon in the top right of your browser <img src="/icons/border-48.png" class="icon">, go to the addition/subtraction page<img src="/popup/res/add_icon_small.png" class="icon">, and click any desired minute count (+5, +15, and +30) to add to your total browsing time.</p>
				<p>If you accidentally added time or want to punish yourself for something (not recommended!), click any desired minute count (-5, -15, and -30) you wish to deduct from your total browsing time. Additionally, "Clear time" can be clicked to reset your browsing time to zero.</p>
